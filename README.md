<center>Astrapi is a template for websites for the modern web.</center>
<center>Powerful experience with lightweight output.</center>

## Install
The only way to install this template is to clone the repository.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/glitchedslimy/Astrapi.git
```

and then install the modules:
```sh
yarn install
```

Before you've done that step, you should have all the code you need inside a folder.

**Strapi comes without information as I don't provide the database back, so you need to create new entries**.

If there's something more custom that you need to include, you will need to modify code as I don't provide any way of editing without coding.

## Documentation
Yes, we do have documentation for this template.

You can go ahead and watch the `/docs` folder inside the code, there you have all the information you need about this template.

## Support

## Contributors
This is a closed project for now, so we don't need more contributors.
